# Frontend boilerplate

## Boilerplate based on Laravel Mix assets compiler
---

* Install assets with: `yarn install`

## Compile assets:

* Production: `yarn run production`
* Development: `yarn run dev`
* Watcher `yarn run watch`

---

## Development server can be started with:

* `php -S localhost:3000`

---
## Simplified bootstrap breakpoint mixins:

* `breakpoint-up()` can be used instead of `media-breakpoint-up()`
* `breakpoint-down()` can be used instead of `media-breakpoint-down()`
* `breakpoint-between()` can be used instead of `media-breakpoint-between()`
* `breakpoint-only()` can be used instead of `media-breakpoint-only()`
